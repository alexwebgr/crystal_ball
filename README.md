### Purpose
I came across the [ruby_llm](https://github.com/crmne/ruby_llm) gem and I wanted to explore its AI capabilities, so I built a basic chat app with Rails and ruby_llm with Gemini.
I implemented a basic Factory design pattern, parsing Markdown and handling async requests to the API with ActiveJob along with surfacing the result with Turbo Streams from the job.
